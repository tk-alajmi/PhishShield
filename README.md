## 🎯 Project Goals  

PhishShield was conceptualized to combat the rising wave of **email-based cyber threats** that exploit human trust.  

### **Primary Objectives**
- 🧠 Develop an AI-powered engine capable of detecting phishing emails in real time.  
- 🧩 Integrate live threat intelligence feeds (e.g., PhishTank, VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing).  
- 🔐 Provide users and organizations with a web dashboard for visibility and reporting.  
- ⚙️ Apply Agile principles for iterative planning and continuous improvement.  
- 🧾 Establish a risk management and communication framework for security projects.

## 📖 Problem Statement  

Phishing remains one of the most effective attack vectors worldwide, causing credential theft, malware infections, and financial fraud.  
Traditional filters use static blacklists and keyword detection — techniques that fail against modern, AI-crafted phishing emails.  

PhishShield aims to bridge this gap through an adaptive platform that:  

1. **Learns continuously** from new phishing campaigns.  
2. **Analyzes emails contextually** using NLP for intent detection.  
3. **Provides real-time alerts** to prevent users from accessing malicious links.

## 🧠 Conceptual Modules  

| **Module** | **Core Description** |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **1️⃣ Detection Engine** | Scans email content, attachments, URLs and sender behavior using NLP and heuristics. Implements classification of “Legitimate”, “Suspicious”, or “Phishing”. |
| **2️⃣ AI Threat Intelligence** | Integrates external feeds (PhishTank, VirusTotal) and re-trains ML models with new campaigns using scikit-learn / TensorFlow. |
| **3️⃣ User & Admin Dashboard** | Interactive portal to review alerts, analyze logs, and generate security reports (React or React Admin). |
| **4️⃣ Notification & Alert Center** | Pushes real-time alerts when phishing is detected. Includes severity levels (high, medium, low). |
| **5️⃣ Security Controls** | Implements authentication (Auth0 / Firebase), encryption, RBAC, and audit logging. |
